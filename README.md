# HelixSmash

The game "HelixSmash" is developed for CET372. Unity Engine is used to develop.

Features expected from the project:

- 20 blocks are lined up one after the other in a central column. The column and ball can be designed at the interface, but blocks are created and placed with code. The blocks constantly rotate at a certain speed in the center of the column.

- The ball jumps regularly when no key is pressed

- Pressing the Space button moves the ball downwards, each block has black and orange colors. If the ball hits the black section while the space key is pressed, the game is over. If the ball hits the orange block, the block disappears and the next block is passed.

- If the ball is dropped below a certain level, the camera will follow the ball.
